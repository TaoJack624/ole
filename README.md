# Ol√©

This is a FORK of the Boundless project, the original code is at boundlessgeo/ole on github.

Integration of OpenLayers 5 and Esri ArcGIS REST services.

Provides the following functionality:
  * translation of ArcGIS REST API styling to OpenLayers 5 styles
  * automatic configuration of tile and image layers from the ArcGIS REST API

## Getting started

Currently I am just testing code so there is no "getting started" or build required,
just run "npm start" or "npm startchrome".

    npm install
    npm run build

## Unit tests

*** I don't have this working right now. ***
    npm start
    http://127.0.0.1:1234/test/index.html

## Linting

*** I don't have this working right now. ***
   npm run lint

## Examples

    npm start
    http://127.0.0.1:1234/
or
    npm run chrome
    (starts a chrome browser for you)

## Using npm

There is no package on npmjs.com but you can use a git type url for instance:
    "dependencies": {
      "ole": "brian32768/ole#0.6.3"
    }
